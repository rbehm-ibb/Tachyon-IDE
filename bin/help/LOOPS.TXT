LOOPS.TXT
 FOR ( cnt -- )	Enter a FOR NEXT loop which will loop for cnt times. A default index FROM 0 and a index step BY 1 is used unless these are overridden before FOR using FROM and/or BY.

 NEXT ( -- )	Decrement the FOR count and exit if zero. Always increment the FROM index by BY. On exit pop the four loop parameters from the loop stack A default index FROM 0 and a index step BY 1 is used unless these are overridden before FOR using FROM and/or BY.

 FROM ( start -- ) Set the

Examples:
--- Display all printable ASCII characters
$20 FROM 96 FOR I EMIT NEXT
--- Display all printable ASCII characters in reverse
$7F FROM -1 BY 96 FOR I EMIT NEXT

Details:
Loops are standardized in V4.5 using FOR NEXT in that DO LOOP +LOOP and Tachyon variants ADO and FORDO are deprecated.
Even though the traditional FOR NEXT did not maintain an index or allowed variable steps like DO LOOP, these are
still maintained by FOR NEXT in V4.5 by augmenting it with two basic instructions
FROM and BY to both specify the starting index and the step value to increment the index BY

The loop stack is maintained in hub RAM at $180 for COG 0. Any other Tachyon cogs should allocate 12 to 16 bytes typically
for 3 to 4 levels recommended (rarely reaches 4)

Each FOR will push four parameters onto the loop stack being:
FOR		The number of times FOR NEXT will loop (not affected by BY)
FROM		The value that the index starts FROM (0 if not set)
BY		The value to increment the FROM index I by (1 if not set)
BRANCH		The address after FOR which is used by NEXT

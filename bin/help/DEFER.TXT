DEFER		DEFER the code that follows in this definition so that it executes at the end of the command line.

When a word needs more information that is supplied postfix it becomes necessary to defer any more action
until that information becomes available. So the code address following defer is placed on a defer stack.
Also because an action is deferred this permits unresolved words to be stored as strings to be processed
by the deferred action. At the end of line execution the defer stack is processed FIFO style.

Example:
pre SQUARE	DEFER    PRINT" is " DUP * . ;

Result:
SQUARE 14 is 196

In this case SQUARE deferred execution until after 14 was already processed and so was
able to read the number postfix style. Note that a pre-emptive defintion is used as we
want it to execute immediately it is encounted and then in this case defer further action
until the end of the line.

Example:
pre pass	OFF ANYCASE DEFER	" forth" $= IF PRINT" Welcome!" ELSE PRINT" incorrect password" THEN ;

Before deferring execution "pass" disables auto case conversion so that any word that is not recognized after pass
does not get converted before Tachyon retries after which it becomes a string.
So after DEFER we can expect a string on the stack which must match our password.
In the event that an empty line is presented the defer action is still active so typing the actual password
on a new line will still work.

Misc examples:
pre SHOW DEFER  DUP " VARIABLES" $= IF DROP .VARS EXIT THEN " ROMS" $= IF lsroms THEN ;

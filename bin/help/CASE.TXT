CASE.TXT

 SWITCH ( val -- ) 	Store the switch value in the task's (cog's) switch register or stack. This value is then referenced by CASE statements.

 CASE ( val -- )	Compare the value with the switch register value and execute following code if equal. Equivalent to "SWITCH@ = IF"

 BREAK ( -- )	Terminate execution and return to caller. Equivalent to "EXIT THEN"

 SWITCH@ ( -- val )	Fetch the switch value usually to use directly or to perform another type of comparison such as WITHIN etc.

Examples:
pub MYCASE ( val -- )
	--- store value to SWITCH register
	SWITCH
	$0D CASE PRINT"  Welcome!" CR BREAK
	$20 CASE PRINT"  <making room> " BREAK
	--- discard return address to escape
	$1B CASE R> DROP PRINT" Escaping " CR BREAK
	--- default is just to echo the character
	SWITCH@ EMIT
	;

pub DEMOCASE	BEGIN KEY MYCASE AGAIN ;
